# 3D Graphics Engine

### I'm currently in process of rewriting this project.

This was a fun project to learn about 3D graphics and shaders and such but some of the design choices I've made here are not exacly great. I've decided that rather than trying to fix this project, it will be a lot easier to just write the whole thing again. I'll be able to reuse a good chunk of the existing code but I'll have to give some more thought on the design patterns I use in the new version. This old version was more about just quickly piecing something together to draw 3D graphics on the screen. I will publish the new version as soon as I make some more progress with it.

A simple 3D engine written in C++ and using OpenGL. I am writing this as an exercise for myself so the code does change quite a lot as I progress and experiment with new concepts. I've combined a bunch of techniques that I've learned from many different online resources, mainly the YouTube channels The Cherno (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) and ChiliTomatoNoodle (https://www.youtube.com/user/ChiliTomatoNoodle) and the website https://learnopengl.com/. If it's not obvious, I'm not a master of 3D graphics (yet), so don't expect to see the most bleeding edge technology or the best practices of 3D software engineering in this repo. I figured that since I intend to use git anyway, I might as well publish this project on github.
