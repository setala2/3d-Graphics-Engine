#3d Graphics Engine

A simple (-ish?) 3d engine written in C++ and using OpenGL. I don't know much about graphics programming and I'm writing this to learn more, so don't expect to see the most bleeding edge technology or the best practices of 3d software engineering in this repo. I figured that since I intend to use git anyway, I might as well publish this project on github.
