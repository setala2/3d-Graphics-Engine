# 3d Graphics Engine

A simple 3D engine written in C++ and using OpenGL. I am writing this as an exercise for myself so the code does change quite a lot as I progress and experiment with new concepts. I've combined a bunch of techniques that I've learned from many different online resources, mainly the YouTube channels The Cherno (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) and ChiliTomatoNoodle (https://www.youtube.com/user/ChiliTomatoNoodle) and the website https://learnopengl.com/. If it's not obvious, I'm not a master of 3D graphics (yet), so don't expect to see the most bleeding edge technology or the best practices of 3D software engineering in this repo. I figured that since I intend to use git anyway, I might as well publish this project on github.
